# HarmlessBird's Website

This project is used by me (HarmlessBird) to give information about myself
and in the future work that I do. 

On the website you will find some information about me and all of my links 
to different social media.



      
## üê¶ About Me  

Hewwo!

You can call me Bird,  
I am a 19-year-old student studying at university in New Zealand.  

While I find peace while observing the beauty of birds, lose myself in gaming, and thrive on the creativity of coding.  
I am also an advocate for inclusivity and love collecting squishmallows. 

Let's chat about birds, games, code, or anything else that sparks your curiosity!
