                As a 20-year-old trans woman living in New Zealand, my story begins with discovery. At 13, I started questioning my gender identity while exploring online furry communities. Those late-night browsing sessions became more than entertainment. They became self-exploration.<br><br>

                The furry community welcomed me immediately. Through forums and Discord servers, I found people who understood identity exploration and creative expression. These weren't just online friendships. They became genuine support networks that helped me through difficult times.<br><br>

                Figuring out who I was at 16 was the start of everything. She/her pronouns felt right from day one. Although I never told my family even to this day, the community's acceptance of diverse identities made my transition feel natural rather than revolutionary.<br><br>

                My transition journey includes starting HRT at 20, as well as my legal name change at the same time.<br><br>

                Professional environments posed new challenges. Job interviews required balancing authenticity with safety. I generally seek workplaces that explicitly support LGBTQ+ employees and contribute to inclusive hiring practices. <br><br>

                The furry community taught me valuable lessons about collaboration and communication. Organizing meetups, managing Discord servers, and coordinating convention groups developed my project management skills. These experiences transferred directly to my technical work and leadership abilities.<br><br>

                Convention attendance became a regular part of my year. Furry conventions offer unique networking opportunities and creative workshops. The inclusive environment lets me practice public speaking and event coordination while connecting with like-minded people who won't judge.<br><br>

                Today, my identity as a trans furry community member and developer feels integrated rather than compartmentalized. Each aspect influences the others: community involvement teaches empathy, event coordination develops organizational skills, and my transition experience builds resilience. Problems become puzzles to solve rather than obstacles to endure.<br><br>

                My journey continues daily. New community connections challenge me socially. Advocacy opportunities expand my impact. Technical projects push professional boundaries. Each challenge becomes data for growth, each setback becomes material for helping others navigate similar paths.
